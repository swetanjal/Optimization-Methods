    "  The objective of this assignment is to show the applications of linear programming in real life problems. You will be asked to solve problems from classical physics to puzzles. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions \n",
    "  - For each question you need to write the formulation in markdown and solve the problem using `cvxpy`. \n",
    "  - Ensure that this notebook runs without errors when the cells are run in sequence.\n",
    "  - Plagarism will not be tolerated.\n",
    "  - Use only `python3` to run your code.\n",
    "  - If you are facing issues running the notebook on your local system. Use google collab to run the notebook online. To run the notebook online, go to [google collab](!https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Go to `File  -> Upload Notebook` and import the notebook file \n",
